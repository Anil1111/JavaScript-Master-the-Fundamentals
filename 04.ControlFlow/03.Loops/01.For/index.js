// for (initialExpression; condition; incrementExpression)

// initialExpression - here we declare an initialized variable
// i - is short for index and is a common convention to use in for loops. This is what we call LOOP VARIABLE.

// condition - So here we want to add acondition and compare the value of i with something else. 
// This loop will run as long as this condition evaluates to true.

// incrementExpression


for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log ('Hello Got Sefiyyar', i);
